                            <p>Hi! I'm the DC Permit Navigator. I can help you figure out which permits, licenses, or certifications you need from DC government agencies.</p>
                            <p>Try asking something like:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>"What do I need to open a restaurant?"</li>
                                <li>"How do I get a building permit for a home renovation?"</li>
                                <li>"I want to host a block party on my street"</li>
                                <li>"What permits does a food truck need?"</li>

                <h2>About This Project</h2>
                <p>Washington DC has <strong>103+ different permits</strong> spread across <strong>16 different agencies</strong>, each with its own application portal, fee structure, and process. There is no single place to find them all.</p>

                <p>A restaurant owner might need to navigate DOB, DC Health, ABCA, DDOT, FEMS, and DLCP — all separately, with no one telling them the full list up front. A homeowner wanting to renovate might discover mid-project that they need historic preservation review, an erosion control plan, and a public space permit they never knew existed.</p>

                <p>This project is a proof of concept: an AI chatbot backed by a hand-curated database of every DC permit we could find. It's designed to answer the question <em>"what do I need?"</em> and point you to the right agency.</p>

                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>When you ask a question, your query is matched against our permit database using semantic search (vector embeddings). The most relevant permits are retrieved and used as context for an AI model (Claude) to generate a natural language answer with specific permits, agencies, fees, and application links.</p>

                <h3>What It Costs</h3>
                <p>The entire stack runs on serverless AWS infrastructure for under $5/month. There's no database, no always-on servers, and no API Gateway. When nobody's asking questions, it costs essentially nothing.</p>

                <h3>Open Source</h3>
                <p>The permit database and all source code are open source on <a href="https://github.com/realmwell/dc-permit-navigator" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. If you spot a missing permit or incorrect information, please open an issue or PR.</p>

                <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>This is an informational tool only. Always verify permit requirements directly with the issuing DC government agency. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the DC government.</p>
